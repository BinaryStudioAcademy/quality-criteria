    How to use this guide
</h2>

<details>
    This guide is separated into several sections, grouped by common rules context(e.g. basics, classes, architecture, design etc.). Each section has a unique prefix for easier navigation. These sections are:
    - <i>B</i> - <a href ='./base.md'>Base</a>. Contains general programming best-practices that can be applied not only to Java;
    - <i>CODE</i> - <a href ='./code.md'>Code style</a>. Contains general and Java-specific code formatting best practices;
    - <i>FUNC</i> - <a href ='./function.md'>Function</a>. Contains best-practices and tactical patterns to apply when designing functions/methods;
    - <i>CLS</i> - <a href ='./class.md'>Class</a>. Contains generic OOP best-practices and Java-specific rules;
    - <i>ARCH</i> - <a href ='./architecture.md'>Architecture</a>. Contains generic architecture implementation advices;
    - <i>SEC</i> - <a href ='./security.md'>Security</a>. Generic and Java-specific security-related advices;
    - <i>MISC</i> - <a href ='./misc.md'>Miscellaneous</a>. Performance, UX, monitoring and other best practices, but are out of scope of this;

    Mandatory rules are prefixed with <i>M</i>, e.g. <i>M-CLS-5</i> is a mandatory rule #5 from Class section, while <i>MISC-3</i> is an optional rule from Miscellaneous section.
